    "- To have something sane between integers and crazy floats.  \n",
    "- I import the Decimal class and then create objects, like so  \n",

    "    from decimal import Decimal\n",
    "    a = Decimal('0.1')\n",
    "    b = Decimal('0.2')\n",

    "- I can still refer to the tuples with the numeric indices.  \n",
    "- I can do a `._replace` to replace values, if I want to. `me._replace(first ='Mario')`. It just returns a new object with the same name, which I can choose to catch in a *new* variable.  \n",

    "- So I could pass it basic primitives, like a list with no entries and it will return an empty list for a value  everytime, there is not one. Or saying int, in which case it will create a key with 0 for a value  \n",

    "    from collections import defaultdict  \n",
    "    d = defaultdict(int)  \n",
    "    ```  \n",

    "- The `id` of a variable shows me where the object in refers to, is located in memory.  \n",
    "If `x=5` then the `id(x)` will point to where it’s object, here the number 5, is located in memory.  \n",
    "- When I assign a variable to another, what I actually do is assign the new variable to the same objects address. That is all. When I do `x = y`, then y will point to 5 too, independent of x. If I set x to something else later, y is not going to follow x. Instead it steadfastly points to 5.  \n",
    "- A simple way to say this is `x is y`, where I am *not* checking for equality, but rather testing the fact, that both of them point to the same location in memory, or not.  \n",
    "- I can use `sys.getsizeof()` to find the size of an object in memory. (how much memory it uses), but it’s a tricky beast. For e.g. when it shows me the size of a list, it shows me the size of the list object. Not the size of the elements it contains. To get that, I need to go check the size of its elements one by one.  \n",
    "- A singleton object (not many in Python) is an object that every time you create a new instance of, from the parent class, it always points back to the same instance. `None` is an example in Python.  \n",
    "- Better to create a list using square brackets, rather than assigning them via a string. `x = ['a','b','c','d']` works better than going `x = list('abcd')`. This obviously matters upon what you are doing and if that is possible to do or not.   \n",
    "- I can tuple-unpack-split a string in various ways. If I go, `a, b, *c = s.split[]` it will get the first split item in a, the next one in b, and the rest will be a list in c. But if I want the first and last elements for example and don’t care about the stuff in the middle, I can also go, `a, *b, c = s.split()`. I need to play with this. Just realised I could’ve solved a lot of exercises I did in the past, more elegantly if I knew this then.  \n",
    "- If I access an element in a sequence via its index, I will get the element back along with the *elements type*, but if I slice a sequence to get just one element back, I get a single element of the *sequence’s type*. Very nifty!  \n",
    "  - For example if I access `s[0]` in the list `['jason', 'braganza']`, then I will get a string `jason` back.  \n",
    "  - But if I slice and get just the first element with a `s[:1]` (get upto, but not including 1), I get a single element *list*, `['jason']` back.  \n",
    "- If I look up a key `z` in a dictionary `d` with a `d[z]` and it does not exist, then I get a `KeyError`. If I want to check keys without noise, I use the `get` method on a dictionary. If the key exists, the value is returned. If not `None` comes back.  \n",
    "  - I can set keys similarly with the `setdefault` key if I want to set keys safely. If I just do `d[z] = 100` and z already existed, its value would have gotten trampled and set to 1000. But if I do the samething with a `d.setdefault(z, 100)` then it sets it to 100 *only* if the key does not exist. If it does, it just returns the old existing value. No harm, no foul.  \n",
    "- If I have two dictionaries and I want the contents of one in the other, then I use the update method. For e.g., I have dictionary a and dictionary b, so I do `a.update(b)` and everything from b flows into a.  \n",
    "  - If there is overlap in the keys, then the values get trampled and overwritten.\n",
    "- I normally cannot add dictionaries, lists, or other sets *to* my sets (no *unhashable* types allowed), I can freeze a set with `frozenset`, which makes it hashable and then add it to my set.  \n",

    "- Reuven makes Python sound like a cute animated bear. ‘Python notices and says “Oh, you’re using 256. I’ve aleady got that. Don’t create a new object for that!”’ I wish my interpreter was as helpful 😂 \n",
    "- This course is a lot less structured than the basic courses. It approaches you from the point of view, that you know stuff, you can read and write Python, you have a modicum of intelligence, so here’s a really juicy grab bag of interesting stuff about all the basics you learnt earlier.  \n",
