Working my way through as many [Reuven Lerner courses][rl] as I can, in a bid to learn how to program and do lots of exercises for fluency.  
Wish me luck!  
  
This is a very messy personal repo, with every thing strewn about haphazardly.  
Lots of random iPython files and .py files.  
I donâ€™t even know, why I made this public.  
Probably to hold myself accountable.
