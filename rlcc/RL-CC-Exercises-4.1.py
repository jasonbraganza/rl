Problem

(1) Assume that we can calculate a word's "score" by
    adding the scores of each letter -- where a=1, b=2,
    c=3, and so forth (ignoring case).  Ask the user for
    a sentence, and then create a dict based on that
    sentence, in which the keys are the words and the
    values are the "scores" for the words.

    bad cab   # output will be {'bad':4, 'cab':6} 

    ord('a') # 97 == ASCII value
