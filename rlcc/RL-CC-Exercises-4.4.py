Problem

(4) Create a set comprehension from words.txt (the Linux
    dictionary).

    Use that set comprehension to create a dict (using
    a dict comprehension).  Ask the user to enter
    a sentence.  The output dict will be the user's words,
    and the values will be True/False, indicating if the
    word is in the dictionary.

    This is a floople test  => {'This':True,
                    'is':True, 'a':True, 'floople':False,
		    'test':True}
