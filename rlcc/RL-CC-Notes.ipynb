    "\n",
    "- If I want a set of uniques from a group, I could use a set.  \n",
    "    - Or like Reuven likes to joke, a set is a dictionary with no values; an immoral dictionary ðŸ˜‚\n",
    "- Create it with a `somesetcomp = set('somecondition' for a something in somethingbig)` or in a simpler manner, `somesetcomp = {'somecondition' for something in somethingbig}`  \n",
    "    - Protip, better to start with a list comprehension, be done with figuring out stuff and then just switch the brackets at the end. Fewer issues that way.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "** Dictionary Comprehensions **  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Create it like so `somedictcomp = {somekey:somevalue for something in somethingbig}`\n",
    "- It creates only one dictionary, not a set\n",
    "- It *has* to have a key and a value variable, seperated by a colon. If it is just a single variable, Iâ€™ll end up with a set comprehension.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "** Nested Comprehensions **  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Running a comprehension on the elements of a parent comphrehension is a nested comprehension.  \n",
    "    - For e.g. if I had a list of lists and I needed to pull out each element from each list I would  \n",
    "        - create a comprehension that would get each list from my giant list of lists  \n",
    "        - and then run a comprehension on those lists to get each element out.  \n",
    "        - `big_list = [[10, 20], [30, 40], [50, 60], [70, 80]]\n",
    "        - `elemental_list = [each_element for each_list in big_list for each_element in each_list]`  \n",
    "- Pretty handy when needed. I can go as many levels deep as needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Why Comprehensions? **  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- A comprehension is needed or rather the better tool for the job, when I have one sequence and I want to turn it into another sequence. Creating new things from old things  \n",
    "- If I am interested in the side effects, the actions, umm, like printing to the screen for example, that is when Iâ€™d use `for` loops.  \n",
    "- It gets increasingly obvious, the more I use it.  \n",
