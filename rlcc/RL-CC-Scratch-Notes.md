Working on Set Comprehension exercises today.  

## Reflections and Experience  
  
- I really need feedback, when it comes to programming. I cannot face a blank page. I always seem to start with printing something out to screen and then my brain kind of kicks into gear. Everything after that is just type, print, is this what I expected, if not then fix, type, print â€¦  
- Exercise 3.1 and I think, I am *finally* getting good handle on comprehensions.  
    - from something that would take me at least 10 lines of code to just expressing it concisely in 1!
