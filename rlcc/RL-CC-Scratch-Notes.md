Working on Set Comprehension exercises today.  

## Reflections and Experience  
  
- I really need feedback, when it comes to programming. I cannot face a blank page. I always seem to start with printing something out to screen and then my brain kind of kicks into gear. Everything after that is just type, print, is this what I expected, if not then fix, type, print â€¦  
- Exercise 3.1 and I think, I am *finally* getting good handle on comprehensions.  
    - from something that would take me at least 10 lines of code to just expressing it concisely in 1!  
- I can read Python messages and take a gander at what I need to do next.  
    - I see a `'_io.TextIOWrapper' object` and know I can iterate over it.  
    - I see `AttributeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object has no attribute 'strip'` and realise that it cannot be stripped into parts. I need another way to skin that cat.  
- And then I took it too far (just like this sentence), and nested a comprehension in another one, in where, I had to learn how to put in a conditional in the form of a ternary operator, in Exercise 3.2 (the commented for loop is much simpler!), but that was *very good* practice. Really stretched me!
