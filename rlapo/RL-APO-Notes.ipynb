    "- Abstract base classes\n",
    "    - Sounds all high and mighty, but does something pretty logical and simple  \n",
    "    - Helps me test if my object is of a generic (of sorts) type. I don’t want to test if 5 is an integer or a float or any of the other various county types in Python. I just want to see if it’s a number, of some sort. The abstract base class `numbers` helps me do that.  \n",
    "    - There are such classes for strings and files, I hear.  \n",
    "    - Will go into learning more about them in detail later, as I actually write more Python. But at least I know *what* they are now.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "** Part 3, Context Managers**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Again, Context Managers, sound like something really complex, but they are just a matter of writing and doing things in a certain manner.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- It’s something like a [Tiny Habit stack loop][mjah], I learnt in the Atomic Habits book, as I was building up new habits.  \n",
    "    - *When* I do this, \n",
    "    - *then* I will do this immediately *after*.  \n",
    "    - and when I am done, I will do *that.*  \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Context Managers have a similar paradigm.  \n",
    "    - With this object *(as this variable, optionally)*  \n",
    "        - I will run the `__enter__` method  \n",
    "        - *then after,* I will do stuff  \n",
    "        - and when I am done, I will run the `__exit__` method  \n",
    "    - I can add the context manager protocol to my objects too, by impletementing the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods in my classes  \n",
    "    - They are used in a particular context, where you want to turn something on and then turn something off, before and after that context, thus *Context Manager*.  \n",
    "        - I can set something up in my `__enter__` method and then tear it down in my `__exit__` method.  \n",
    "        - This could be, for example, a network connection, a file, a redefinition of some sort, etc.  \n",
    "        - The `__enter__` method must return self if all has to work well.  \n",
    "        - The `__exit__` block, takes four arguments, one for `self`, one for an error class, one for the object, and one for the address in memory, the traceback. I can use them to catch errors in the main body of my with block, and then decide what the appropriate way to deal with them is.  \n",
    "        - A good example is using redirecting the `print` function’s output to a file, using a context manager. (The print function can write to a file, when I specify it as an output device like so `print (\"Hello there\", file=f)`\n",
    "        - While I might be able to catch errors in the body of the context manager, I cannot if something happens during `__enter__`. just something to be aware of.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Contextlib is a library of context managers, Python already provides us.  \n",
    "    - `import contextlib`  \n",
    "    - `contextlib.redirect_stdout/err` will redirect stuff from the default output (the screen) to whereever else you want it to.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "** Part 4, Properties and Descriptors **  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- A ***property*** is an attribute, that acts like getters/setters in other languages. It uses methods to set other attributes in the class (within the bounds we set). For e.g. a `.temp` property that will let you set temperatures, but only in the range you specify. not below 18C and not above 25C.  \n",
    "- set by putting `@property` atop a getter function (let’s say `temp`) and then defining the setter properties in an identically named `temp` function again but decorated with `@function_name.setter`; in our case `@temp.setter`  \n",
    "- the whole actual way to do it is like a contortionist twisting into a pretzel shape. Getting fluent with this will take time and practice.  \n",
    "- it basically (to my mind) is like me giving someone something, and that someone goes and magician like, does something marvellous with that something, instead of just storing it in their pocket. it looks like assigning data to an attribute, but behind the scenes there are methods, just waiting to weave spells on said data.  \n",
    "- When I take a property out of a class and abstact it, so that it can be used by many classes, it’s called a ***descriptor.*** (kinda like abstracting functions out of program files and into modules)  \n",
    "- To kinda formally state, a descriptor is a class whose instances are supposed to be class attributes in other classes.  \n",
    "    - To fit the descriptor protocol, a descriptor class needs to implement… \n",
    "        - a `__get__(self, host_instance, host_class)` method with a corresponding `__set__(self, host_instance, new_value_to_set)` method\n",
    "    - These are class specific. As in, the descriptor is shared amongst all the instances it is used in.  \n",
    "    - To get instance specific descriptors, you set the value that you are changing to be assigned as a dictionary using the host instance as the key and the value, as the value. (More contorting!) and then return the value of the `[host_instance]` value.  \n",
    "    - Definitely tons of practice needed with this.  \n",
    "    - Not used much, in day to day work, but used heavily behind the scenes by Python itself for its object system. The methods, Python classes have, are plain old functions, with descriptors (in conjunction with weak referenced elements) applied to them. T\n",
    "    - The more I dive into all of this, the more Python feels less magical and more like the work of thousands of hard working atomic elements. And I think, I like this better. That everything complex, is actually lots of simple pieces, working together in concert.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "** Part 5, Advanced Topics **  \n",
    "- The only thing I can write here, is that Reuven goes deep into hijacking how Python creates classes and then using them for our own customised ends. How to create my own custom `__new__` method, my own custom `__init__` method, my own custom `type` of object, create my own class with a metaclass…\n",
    "- Never going to use this, unless I am writing the next Django or something, and even then I doubt, these would be needed 😂 \n",
    "- But this was so much fun to learn!\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Part 1, Advanced Methods.**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This section focuses on the dunder methods in Python.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- By default objects are not `equal` to other objects even they they are from the same class, with the same attributes and methods.  \n",
    "    - We could implement our own `equals` method though.  \n",
    "    - The point being, we need to be *intentional* and methodical, when we design and implement our classses\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Static methods are plain old functions that I write in my class for use by *both* the class and the instance. Could be used to clean up input or similar such utility functions. I create them by putting a `@staticmethod` decorator atop my method.  \n",
    "- Class methods are those that are meant for use by only the class. I can call them from my instances, but they act on the class. I create them by using the `@classmethod` atop my method. For clarity, the first variable is now written as `cls` instead of `self`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2, Inheritance.**  \n",
    "- MRO, Method Resolution Order. I can do an `classname.__mro__` to see how Python goes about looking for methods upwards, specially if I’m inheriting from multiple objects. Running help on an object also lists the MRO of its methods.     \n",
    "- Best to explicity inherit from all parent classes, when inheriting from multiple classes.  \n",
    "- We can use the `classname.__bases__` to check for the classes parents.  \n",
    "- A `mixin` is a class, we can inherit from (probably in addition to and before our parent class), that just adds functionality to our class. Does nothing sematically / organizationally to our objects or classes.  \n",
    "    - The mixin *must come first.*  \n",
    "- Adding an `__` before an attribute, signifies that it is not to be touched. A little security by obscurity too. Nothing’s stopping me from actually going and changing things up. It’s just a notifier to people with common sense that such stuff ought not to be tampered with.  \n",
    "    - The main reason though is to prevent conflict between attribute names.  \n",

    "## Learning / Feedback/ Experiences from doing exercises   \n",
    "  \n",
    "- This course feels like the O’Reilly cookbooks in video form.  \n",
    "- The first section takes all the operators, I take for granted in Python and then shows me how to implement them with my own classes\n",
    "    - how do I get `len` to work on my object? or how do I implement the `==` operator in my classes? etc. etc.\n",
    "- Starting with the last one and this one, have given up on exercises and just taking notes for now. As soon as I finish the run, I will be then going on an exercise binge with these pending exercises as well as Reuven’s [Python Workout][rlpw].  \n",
    "   - The execption being, if I run into a topic that is *really* confusing, then I will attempt the exercises to drill the idea immediately into my head.  \n",
    "- Obligatory Reuven plug, since I started up a new course :)\n",
    "    - Reuven is an awesome teacher.  \n",
    "    - He takes the time, to explain stuff in *painstaking detail*, leaving nothing as an “exercise to the reader”.\n",
